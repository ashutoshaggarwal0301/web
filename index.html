    <main>
        <p>Java is a high-level, versatile, and widely-used programming language that was created by James Gosling and released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It was designed to be platform-independent, allowing developers to write code that could run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>

        <p>Java quickly gained popularity due to its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy, which made it a suitable choice for developing cross-platform applications and applets for web browsers.</p>

        <p>Over the years, Java has gone through several versions and updates, introducing new features and improvements. It has found extensive use in a variety of fields, including web development, mobile app development (Android), enterprise software, and more.</p>

        <p>Java's strong community, rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, and its continued evolution have contributed to its enduring relevance in the world of programming.</p>
